# Credits

* A great many thanks to the BourbakIA winning team (Jean-Matthieu Schertzer, Cédric Faucheux, Jean Cupe, Nicolas Béguin and David Cortés) ! this methodology and prototype which has led to AntakIA is the direct following of that 2-day hackathon organised by the French financial regulator ([ACPR](https://acpr.banque-france.fr)). Special thanks to Jean-Matthieu, for his great work developping [Skope-Rules](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/skope-rules)...
* We are also very grateful to the [Confiance.AI](https://www.confiance.ai) national French initiative, for helping us try this approach with great French industrial actors, to increase adoption and robustness of high risk models.
* We also try the calculation of Banzhaf indices (not only Shapley) more stable and less computer intensive following our ongoing discussion with the [CRIL](https://www.cril.univ-artois.fr) (Centre de Recherche en Informatique de Lens, Pierre Marquis, Gilles Audemard, Jean-Marie Lagniez, Steve Bellart, Louenas Bounia). Quite a lot more to come ! and do have a look at this quite promising initiative on X-AI by the CRIL
* Special thanks to the [Jupyter project](https://jupyter.org) team. Without Jupyter, some particular AntakIA wouldn't be possible : ipywidgets or [ipyvuetify](https://github.com/widgetti/ipyvuetify) from the great Widgetti team ...
* Thanks to SoyHuCe, Weituo Dai, Antoine Edy, Xavier Lekeuka for paving the way !
* Special thanks to the alpha and beta testers...
* And as many other French start-ups, thanks also to [France2030](https://www.gouvernement.fr/france-2030), Mairie de Paris, [Incubateur Telecom Paris](https://incubateur-telecomparis.fr) to help get things started...
