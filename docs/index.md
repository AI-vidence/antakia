### :thought_balloon: Our idea

Our Python library combines all the steps of our regional approach for your model:

- Simultaneous "dyadic" exploration of the value and explanation spaces of your model to be explained,
- Automatic recommendation of dyadic segmentation (regions that are both homogeneous in the 2 spaces) or manual selection
- For each region, expression of the selection made by the input or explained variables (cf. "Skope rules")
- Possibility of refining the definition of regions for each attribute (see "flows")
- For each region, a surrogate model is proposed from a library (including PiML and iModels)
- Performance, continuity and completeness testing of the final model
