# Welcome to AntakIA !

AntakIA is a software allowing you to explore a trained machine learning (ML) model and discover what it has understood from the training data. A key use case is to explain (one speaks of 'explainability' of AI) the model to have it approved and certified to be compliant with the law. As a matter of fact, Europe should issue by the beginning of 2024 or its 'AI act'. This text will require companies, when they use AI for certain use cases, to have their model certified.

AntakIA is a solution for this compliance issue. But it does more. For instancee it allows datascientist to better understand their dataset and model. Marketing teams can get new insights on their customers etc.

AntakIA is an open-source project by AI-vidence, a French company, showcasing our regional approach for AI explainability. Besides local and global explainability, we believe in a more relevant and intermediate scale to observe phenomena. We divide the multidimensional space of input values in regions where we can substitute the original 'black box' model with simmpler and explainable models. Because we split the space in smaller pieces, we named our approach from the antique city Antakia (in TÃ¼rkiye nowadays) famous for its roman mosaics.

Now, you're only a ```pip install antakia``` away from AntakIA  :) ... See our [getting started](getting_started.md) page for detailed instructions
