A key use case is to explain (one speaks of 'explainability' of AI) the model to have it approved and certified to be compliant with the law. As a matter of fact, Europe should issue by the end of 2023 or beginning of 2024 its 'AI act'. This text will require companies, when they use AI for certain use caqes, to have their model certified. AntakIA is an open-source project by AI-vidence, a French company, showcasing our regional approach for AI explainability. Besides local and global explainability, we believe in a more relevant and intermediate scale to observe phenomena. We divide the multidimensional space of input values in regions where we can substitute the original 'black box' model with simmpler and explainable models. Because we split the space in smaller pieces, we named our approach from the antique city Antakia (in T\u00fcrkiye nowadays) famous for its roman mosaics.
