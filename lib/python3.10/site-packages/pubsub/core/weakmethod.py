"""
This module hides the source of implementation of weak ref to a method: for Python 3.4, it is
Python's weakref module; for earlier Python, it is the weakrefmethod module from PyPI.
Prior to pypubsub 4.0, WeakMethod was a custom class that adhered to the WeakRef API.

Use the getWeakRef(object) module function to create the
proper type of weak reference (weakref.WeakRef or WeakMethod) for given object.
