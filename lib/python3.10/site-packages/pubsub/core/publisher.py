        Changes the creation policy for topics.

        By default, pubsub will accept topic names for topics that
        don't have a message data specification (MDS). This default behavior
        makes pubsub easier to use initially, but allows topic
        names with typos to go uncaught in common operations such as
        sendMessage() and subscribe(). In a large application, this
        can lead to nasty bugs. Pubsub's default behavior is equivalent
        to setTopicUnspecifiedFatal(false).

        When called with newVal=True, any future pubsub operation that
        requires a topic (such as subscribe and sendMessage) will require
        an MDS; if none is available, pubsub will raise a TopicDefnError
        exception.

        If checkExisting is not given or True, all existing
        topics are validated. A TopicDefnError exception is
        raised if one is found to be incomplete (has hasMDS() false).

        Returns previous value of newVal.

        Note that this method can be used in several ways:

        1. Only use it in your application when something is not working
           as expected: just add a call at the beginning of your app when
           you have a problem with topic messages not being received
           (for instance), and remove it when you have fixed the problem.

        2. Use it from the beginning of your app and never use newVal=False:
           add a call at the beginning of your app and you leave it in
           (forever), and use Topic Definition Providers to provide the
           listener specifications. These are easy to use via the
           pub.addTopicDefnProvider().

        3. Use it as in #1 during app development, and once stable, use
           #2. This is easiest to do in combination with
           pub.exportTopicTreeSpec().

        oldVal = self.__treeConfig.raiseOnTopicUnspecified
        self.__treeConfig.raiseOnTopicUnspecified = newVal

    def subscribe(self, listener: UserListener, topicName: str, **curriedArgs) -> Listener:
        """
        Subscribe listener to named topic. Raises ListenerMismatchError
        if listener isn't compatible with the topic's MDS. Returns
        (pubsub.core.Listener, success), where success is False if listener
        was already subscribed. The pub.core.Listener wraps the callable
        subscribed and provides introspection-based info about
        the callable. Extra keyword arguments are treated as currying of
        listener arguments.

        Example:
            pub.subscribe(listener1, 'some_topic')
            pub.subscribe(listener2, 'some_other_topic', a=2, b=3)

        In the second example, the listener2 will always receive a=2 and b=3 and
        pubsub treats it as though a and b were curried, i.e. as if the actual
        listener subscribed were a callable that did not have a or b parameters.
        Hence if some_other_topic has a or b as message data, subscription will
        raise a ListenerInadequate error.

        Note that if 'subscribe' notification is on, the handler's
        'notifySubscribe' method is called after subscription.
