    This can be used to wrap functions that are referenced by class
    data if the data should be called as a function. E.g. given
    >>> def func(): pass
    >>> class A:
    ....def __init__(self): self.a = func
    then doing
    >>> boo=A(); boo.a()
    will fail since Python will try to call a() as a method of boo,
    whereas a() is a free function. But if you have instead
    "self.a = Callback(func)", then "boo.a()" works as expected.
