class MultiviewKMeans(BaseCluster):
    r'''This class implements multi-view k-means.

    This class implements multi-view k-means using the co-EM framework
    as described in [#2Clu]_. This algorithm is most suitable for cases
    in which the different views of data are conditionally independent.
    Additionally, this can be effective when the dataset naturally
    contains features that are of 2 different data types, such as
    continuous features and categorical features [#3Clu]_, and then the
    original features are separated into two views in this way.

    This algorithm currently handles two views of data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_clusters : int, optional, default=2
        The number of clusters

    random_state : int, optional, default=None
        Determines random number generation for initializing centroids.
        Can seed the random number generator with an int.

    init : {'k-means++', 'random'} or list of array-likes, default='k-means++'
        Method of initializing centroids.

        'k-means++': selects initial cluster centers for k-means clustering
        via a method that speeds up convergence.

        'random': choose n_cluster samples from the data for the initial
        centroids.

        If a list of array-likes is passed, the list should have a length of
        equal to the number of views. Each of the array-likes should have
        the shape (n_clusters, n_features_i) for the ith view, where
        n_features_i is the number of features in the ith view of the input
        data.

    patience : int, optional, default=5
        The number of EM iterations with no decrease in the objective
        function after which the algorithm will terminate.

    max_iter : int, optional, default=300
        The maximum number of EM iterations to run before
        termination.

    n_init : int, optional, default=5
        Number of times the k-means algorithm will run on different
        centroid seeds. The final result will be the best output of
        n_init runs with respect to total inertia across all views.

    tol : float, default=1e-4
        Relative tolerance with regards to inertia to declare convergence.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of jobs to use for computation. This works by computing
        each of the n_init runs in parallel.
        None means 1. -1 means using all processors.

    Attributes
    ----------
    labels_ : array-like, shape (n_samples)
        Cluster labels for each sample in the fitted data.

    centroids_ : list of array-likes
        ``centroids_`` length: n_views
        ``centroids_[i]`` shape: (n_clusters, n_features_i)

        The cluster centroids for each of the two views. ``centroids_[0]``
        corresponds to the centroids of view 1 and ``centroids_[1]``
        corresponds to the centroids of view 2.

    Notes
    -----
    Multi-view k-means clustering adapts the traditional k-means clustering
    algorithm to handle two views of data. This algorithm requires that a
    conditional independence assumption between views holds true. In cases
    where both views are informative and conditionally independent, multi-view
    k-means clustering can outperform its single-view analog run on a
    concatenated version of the two views of data. This is quite useful for
    applications where you wish to cluster data from two different modalities
    or data with features that naturally fall into two different partitions.
    Multi-view k-means works by iteratively performing the maximization and
    expectation steps of traditional EM in one view, and then using the
    computed hidden variables as the input for the maximization step in
    the other view. This algorithm, referred to as Co-EM, is described
    below.

    |

    *Co-EM Algorithm*

    Input: Unlabeled data D with 2 views

    #. Initialize :math:`\Theta_0^{(2)}`, T, :math:`t = 0`.

    #. E step for view 2: compute expectation for hidden variables given

    #. Loop until stopping criterion is true:

        a. For v = 1 ... 2:

           i. :math:`t = t + 1`

           ii. M step view v: Find model parameters :math:`\Theta_t^{(v)}`
               that maximize the likelihood for the data given the expected
               values for hidden variables of view :math:`\overline{v}` of
               iteration :math:`t` - 1

           iii. E step view :math:`v`: compute expectation for hidden
                variables given the model parameters :math:`\Theta_t^{(v)}`


    #. return combined :math:`\hat{\Theta} = \Theta_{t-1}^{(1)} \cup
       \Theta_t^{(2)}`

    The final assignment of examples to partitions is performed by assigning
    each example to the cluster with the largest averaged posterior
    probability over both views.

        Predict the cluster labels for the data.

        Parameters
        ----------
        Xs : list of array-likes or numpy.ndarray
            - Xs length: n_views
            - Xs[i] shape: (n_samples, n_features_i)

            This list must be of size 2, corresponding to the two
            views of the data. The two views can each have a different
            number of features, but they must have the same number of samples.

        Returns
        -------
        labels : array-like, shape (n_samples,)
            The predicted cluster labels for each sample.
