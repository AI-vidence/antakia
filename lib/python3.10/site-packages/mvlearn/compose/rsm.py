class RandomSubspaceMethod(TransformerMixin):
    """
    Random Subspace Method [#1RSM]_ for constructing multiple views.
    Each view is constructed by randomly selecting features from X.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_views : int
        Number of views to construct

    subspace_dim : int, float
        Number of features from the data to subsample. If float, is between 0
        and 1 and denotes the proportion of features to subsample.

    random_state : int or RandomState instance, optional (default None)
        Controls the random sampling of features. Set for
        reproducible results.

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_features_  : list, length n_views
        The number of features in the fitted data

    subspace_dim_ : int
        The number of features subsampled in each view

    subspace_indices_ : list of numpy.ndarray, length n_views
        Feature indices to subsample for each view
